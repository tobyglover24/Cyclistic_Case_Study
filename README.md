# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study

Course: [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone) as part of [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)

## Introduction
In this case study, I will perform typical actions of a junior data analyst working at a fictional bike-share company, Cyclistic. To complete the overall business task, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: [Ask](https://github.com/tobyglover24/GDA_CS1_Cyclistic/blob/main/README.md#ask), [Prepare](https://github.com/tobyglover24/GDA_CS1_Cyclistic/blob/main/README.md#prepare), [Process](https://github.com/tobyglover24/GDA_CS1_Cyclistic/blob/main/README.md#process), [Analyse](https://github.com/tobyglover24/GDA_CS1_Cyclistic/blob/main/README.md#analyse), [Share](https://github.com/tobyglover24/GDA_CS1_Cyclistic/blob/main/README.md#share) and [Act](https://github.com/tobyglover24/GDA_CS1_Cyclistic/blob/main/README.md#act)

## Context
### Cyclistic
Cyclistic are a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.
