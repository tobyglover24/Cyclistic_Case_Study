# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study

Course: [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone) as part of [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)

## Introduction
In this case study, I will perform typical actions of a junior data analyst working at a fictional bike-share company, Cyclistic. To complete the overall business task, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: [Ask](https://github.com/tobyglover24/GDA_CS1_Cyclistic/blob/main/README.md#ask), [Prepare](https://github.com/tobyglover24/GDA_CS1_Cyclistic/blob/main/README.md#prepare), [Process](https://github.com/tobyglover24/GDA_CS1_Cyclistic/blob/main/README.md#process), [Analyse](https://github.com/tobyglover24/GDA_CS1_Cyclistic/blob/main/README.md#analyse), [Share](https://github.com/tobyglover24/GDA_CS1_Cyclistic/blob/main/README.md#share) and [Act](https://github.com/tobyglover24/GDA_CS1_Cyclistic/blob/main/README.md#act)

## Context
### Cyclistic
Cyclistic are a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno (the director of marketing) believes that maximising the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analysing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
